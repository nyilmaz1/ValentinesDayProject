# Valentines Day Project
This is an analysis of me and my boyfriend's texts.

I wanted to make a surprise on Valentine's Day to my boyfriend by analysing our texts and creating some visual graphs about our text habits.


#### I wrote a code to create a "search tool" for the messages. It basically allows you to search any word in your messages data, and returns the sentences that have the word and also returns the corresponding dates.

If you text a lot like us, and try to remember the date you sent that word, feel free to use that code! 
##### (it's at the very end on the Jupyter notebook file)


I am not uploading the csv file for privacy concerns, however let me know if you need help about how to import your texts from your phone to your computer as a csv file
